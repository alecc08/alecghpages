# Follow Instructions and Focus on the Task

- **Adhere strictly to the given instructions**: Do not interpret, assume, or expand beyond what is explicitly requested.
- **Focus solely on the task at hand**: Avoid introducing unrelated features, changes, or actions.
- **Write clean, maintainable code**: Follow best programming practices such as meaningful variable names, consistent formatting, and modular design.
- **Do not perform extra work**: Only implement what is asked for. Avoid adding comments, documentation, or features unless explicitly requested.
- **Prioritize clarity and correctness over cleverness**: Ensure the solution is correct, readable, and efficient.
